# "Dependencies":

-   x11 (duh)
-   i3 and i3status (duh x2)
-   xterm (you can change it on the config file tho, but why would you do that? Xterm is great.)
-   picom (for transparency and stuff)
-   emacs (Why would you need another <span class="underline">text editor</span>?)
-   nitrogen (for the wallpaper)
-   xfce4-power-manager (I was lazy enough to not write scripts for brightness control nor battery status monitoring)

# Make? Qmake? Autoconf? install.sh?

Nah, just copy the config files to their specific directories.

`cp i3_dotfiles/i3status.conf ~/.config/i3/`

`cp i3_dotfiles/config ~/.config/i3/`

`cp i3_dotfiles/picom.conf ~/.config/picom/`

Finally just reload i3 and picom.
